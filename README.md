# politrack
Android app giving information about Congressional Representatives. Made in around the 2016 election season. 

Find it on the Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cs.teslastem.politrack)

Information is pulled from the ProPublica API. 
Production version uses my developer key, while if you use this code you will have to insert your own. 
There is a field for that in the MainActivity file. You could also insert it as a shared resource (preferred). 

Just have fun with it.
